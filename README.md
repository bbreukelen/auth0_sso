###Ready to use express Authentication implementation

This is a ready to use node express application that allows for authentication and authorization using Google accounts on auth0.  
The implementation shows a login link.  
The login link sends you to an open auth authentication page which allows for logging in with Google.  
You can specify known google account names and restrict access to those accounts with a single line of code in an express route.  
   
#####How to implement  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbreukelen/auth0_sso.git
cd auth0_sso
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
